## Game Elements

### 1. Characters / Entities

| Element | Description | Category | Reason | How to Prove / Interact |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| 👹 Goblin | Hostile enemy | Enemies | Goblins are interactive adversaries that block progress | Use `rm <goblin>` or `rm -rf <goblin>` (simulated) to defeat |
| 🐲 Kobold | Tough enemy | Enemies | Stronger variant of enemy, requires special command | Use `sudo rm <kobold>` (simulated) to defeat |
| 🧙 Wizard | Deciphers scrolls | Ally | Provides guidance and unlocks new features when given scrolls | Deliver hidden scrolls using `mv <scroll> ./wizard/` |

#### Enemy Damage Rules:

- You take damage if you are in the same folder with an enemy and type a wrong command.

- After deleting one enemy, the remaining enemies in the folder automatically deduct their damage from your health.

- Damage values (base HP = 100):

  - Goblins = 5 per unit

  - Kobolds = 10 per unit

#### Notes:

- Players can handle multiple .mob files simultaneously.

- Each enemy type has a different damage value and acts independently in the same folder.

## ✅ Notes on Gameplay Flow

- **Level 1 Tutorial:** Fully guided; players learn navigation commands safely.
- **Level 2 (Messenger):** Scrolls introduce lore and teach `cat` usage, gradually unlocking gameplay mechanics.
- **Level 3+:** Combat and puzzles rely on a mix of **real sandbox commands** (safe) and **simulated commands** (sensitive).
- **Scrolls:** Each stage may contain scrolls. Reading them is essential to learn enemy weaknesses, key usage, or dungeon lore.
- **Orbs:** Grant passive buffs automatically when collected.
- **Keys & Doors:** Introduce puzzles requiring multiple commands (`mv`, `chmod`, `sudo`).
- **Boss / Arcane Level:** Commands are combined using `&` or `|` for chaining actions — the ultimate test of Terminal Dungeon mastery.
