"GRAND ARCHIVE RESTORATION PROTOCOL:
1. Navigate the deep, confusing subfolders
2. Rename corrupted files to proper names:
   - broken_pillar_* → pillar_*.txt
   - corrupted_core_* → core_*.dat
   - fragment_seal_* → seal_fragment_*.piece
3. Move ALL files to proper archive sections:
   - pillar files → archive_pillars/
   - core files → archive_cores/
   - seal fragments → archive_seals/
4. Some files need sudo authority to modify
5. Some are already named correctly but misplaced"
