# Game Flow
# type "A cold wind sweeps through the stone hall as torches ignite one by one."
# type "An armored figure steps forward — the Old Knight."
# type "\"Squire... you awaken in the Dungeon of Paths. Every warrior who survived began here.\""
# type "\"But before you lift blade or spell, you must first command the dungeon itself.\""
# type "\"Tell me where you stand. Speak the words:  pwd\""
# input
# continue
#
# After 'pwd':
# type "The knight nods slowly."
# type "\"Good. A warrior who knows his ground cannot be easily lost.\""
# type "\"Now, open your eyes to the world around you. Reveal the nearby chambers.\""
# type "\"Use:  ls\""
# input
# continue
#
# After 'ls':
# type "The torchlight flickers, revealing four paths carved into the ancient stone."
# type "\"These halls are your training grounds. You will walk them one at a time — under my command only.\""
# type "\"First, enter the Chamber of Beginnings: basic_training.\""
# type "\"Go now:  cd basic_training\""
# input (only accept cd basic_training)
# continue
#
# Inside basic_training/:
# type "Dust stirs as you step inside. Old banners hang torn but proud."
# type "\"This chamber taught generations of squires before you.\""
# type "\"You have stepped well. Now return to the central hall.\""
# type "Return using:  cd .."
# input
# continue
#
# Back at level_1/:
# type "The knight gestures toward a sunlit archway."
# type "\"Next, the Courtyard of Awareness. A place where young warriors sharpen their senses.\""
# type "\"Enter it now:  cd courtyard\""
# input
# continue
#
# Inside courtyard/:
# type "The courtyard opens wide — birds scatter, leaves rustle, ancient stones glow faintly."
# type "\"Good. Now look carefully and sense the objects around you.\""
# type "\"Use:  ls\""
# input
# continue
#
# After 'ls':
# type "\"You see only what lies in plain sight.\""
# type "\"But the Dungeon of Paths hides many secrets from untrained eyes...\""
#
# Optional hint:
# type "\"If you dare to look deeper, whisper these words: ls -a\""
#
# type "\"Your lesson here is complete. Return to the main hall.\""
# type "Use: cd .."
# input
# continue
#
# Back at level_1/:
# type "The knight leads you toward a corridor ringing with echoes."
# type "\"Now — the Hall of Movement. Only those who understand direction may walk the deeper paths.\""
# type "\"Enter:  cd hall_of_movement\""
# input
# continue
#
# Inside hall_of_movement/:
# type "Lanterns sway as you enter. The walls shift as if watching your every step."
# type "\"Movement is your lifeline. Learn it well, squire.\""
# type "\"Return once more to the central hall.\""
# type "Use: cd .."
# input
# continue
#
# Back at level_1/:
# type "A deep rumble shakes the chamber..."
# type "The knight steps aside as a massive stone door unlocks itself."
# type "\"You have walked the halls with discipline. The Trial of Navigation calls to you now.\""
# type "\"Enter only when ready: cd navigation_test\""
# input
# continue
#
# Inside navigation_test/:
# type "Runes blaze across the floor as you enter."
# type "A stone tablet rises, its voice echoing in your mind:"
# type "'Prove your mastery of movement, squire... or be lost forever.'"
#
# After exploring all halls:
# type "The runes dim. The chamber grows quiet."
# type "The Old Knight appears at your side, his armor gleaming faintly in the darkness."
# type "\"You have done well, young squire. You have walked every hall with patience and discipline.\""
# type "\"Your first trial is complete… but the Dungeon of Paths stretches far deeper than these simple chambers.\""
# type "\"There is much more to explore — secrets, foes, and mysteries waiting in the dark.\""
# type "\"When you are ready, speak the words:  it's done\""
# input (only accept: it's done)
# continue
#
# type "The torches flare brightly, as if acknowledging your progress."
# type "\"Your journey continues, squire. Greater challenges await in the next stage…\""
