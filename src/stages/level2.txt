The Scroll of Scrolls

Beware, young knight. Scrolls speak not just in words, but in secrets.
Each scroll hides knowledge of the dungeon—keys, doors, enemies, and spells.
Read with care, deliver with purpose, and the wizard shall grant what the parchment conceals.

A scroll unread is a path unseen.
A scroll misplaced is power lost.

Apprentice Knight, heed these words:

The shadows of the dungeon are not empty. Small creatures, goblins, roam the passages, mischievous and cunning.
Though they appear weak, even a single goblin can block your path and delay your progress.
Fear not, for you hold the power to remove obstacles with the proper incantation.

Within this scroll lies the secret of command: 'rm'. This simple but mighty rune allows you to remove entities safely in your domain—the sandbox.
To defeat a goblin, navigate to its resting place and execute:

    rm goblin_name.txt

A goblin removed in this way vanishes completely, yet the dungeon’s magic ensures that no harm comes to the sacred realm beyond your sandbox.
Attempting this on forbidden paths will invoke illusions: goblins will vanish, but your curiosity shall be tested without true danger.

Remember: timing and order matter. Observe the goblins' movements. Some will appear only after others have been cleared.

May your hands be steady, and your resolve unwavering.

A mysterious scroll lies before you, blank yet potent:

Though no words appear, you sense a latent magic woven within.
Perhaps the dungeon itself speaks in silence, urging you to explore, investigate, and trust your instincts.
Sometimes, a scroll's power is in what it does not say—an invitation to observation and experimentation.

Scroll of Hidden Lore and Orbs

Beyond the threshold of this hallway lie orbs of power. Small, glowing spheres that hum with mystical energy.
They grant abilities imperceptible yet potent: uncovering hidden files, enhancing your perception, or unlocking commands previously unknown.

Observe the doors carefully. Some doors are locked by magic and key, while others by the mere will of the dungeon.
Your mission is to combine observation, courage, and acquired skills to advance.

Use the knowledge gained: move keys to doors, read scrolls, and collect orbs.
These actions will shape your abilities, preparing you for trials to come.
Each orb may only be taken once, but its influence lingers as long as you tread the dungeon.

Scroll of Doors and Wizard Guidance

Apprentice Knight, you now face the ultimate challenge of this stage.
Doors before you are not mere obstacles—they are guardians of knowledge and treasure.
Some doors require only a key, but others require the harmony of key and command, the combination of physical and mystical effort.

Move the key:

    mv key ./door/

Adjust the permissions as needed:

    chmod 700 ./door/

Deliver scrolls to the wizard when prompted. Only through this ritual can new paths be revealed, secrets unlocked, and abilities bestowed upon you.
The wizard observes your mastery and rewards diligence. Ignore their counsel at your peril.

Remember: patience, precision, and curiosity are your allies. Fail not in your duties, for the dungeon never forgets.
