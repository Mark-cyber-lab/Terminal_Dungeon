FILE: eldritch_realms/corrupted_caverns/goblin.mob
I am the weakest here, just a goblin.
I guard the entrance, nothing more.
Delete others if you must, but not me.
I am merely a scout.

FILE: eldritch_realms/corrupted_caverns/zombie.mob
I shuffle slowly, a mindless zombie.
Stronger than a goblin, but still weak.
I block the path forward aimlessly.
Pass by me if you dare.

FILE: eldritch_realms/forbidden_crypt/kobold.mob
I am a kobold, cunning and swift.
I know secrets of this crypt.
I am stronger than zombie, weaker than ogre.
I might help or hinder you.

FILE: eldritch_realms/void_chamber/ogre.mob
I am an ogre, powerful and slow.
Few can pass my chamber.
I am strong, but not the strongest.
The vampire is fiercer than I.

FILE: eldritch_realms/purging_grounds/vampire.mob
I am a vampire, ancient and swift.
Second only to the demon lord himself.
You must face me before the final boss.
Delete me to prove your worth.

FILE: eldritch_realms/overlord_sanctum/demon_lord.mob
I AM THE DEMON LORD
The final boss, the darkest of all.
The Butcher of all beings
You have reached my sanctum HERO.
Prepare to fight me but beware - any mistake spawns more monsters.
